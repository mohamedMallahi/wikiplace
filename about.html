        Wikiplace is an online free content encyclopedia project helping create
        a world in which everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.
        It is supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on a model of
        freely editable content. The name "Wikiplace" is a blending of the words
        wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the
        Hawaiian word wiki, meaning "quick") and encyclopedia. Wikiplace's
        articles provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with
        additional information.
